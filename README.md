# TatsuBot

Tatsu-chan is forked from [Bot-chan](http://brussell98.github.io/bot/main) and is primarily intended for use on our private [Friday Night Gaming Club](http://www.friday.cafe) Discord server.
If you are looking to set up your own bot, please visit [BrussellBot](http://brussell98.github.io/bot/main) instead.

**This source code is no longer maintained. The current Tatsumaki bot is closed source and the base runs on [iris](https://github.com/pyraxo/iris).**
